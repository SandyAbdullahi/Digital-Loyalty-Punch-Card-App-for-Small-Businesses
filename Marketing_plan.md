# Marketing Plan  
**Promoting the Digital Loyalty / Punch-Card App**

## 1. Marketing Objective  
Generate a steady stream of merchant sign-ups via self-service onboarding and simultaneously build consumer demand to drive network effect — all without manual outreach.

## 2. Audience Segments & Messaging  
### a) Merchants  
- Segment: Cafés, beauty salons, small retail stores in Nairobi/Kenya (and East Africa)  
- Pain points: “How to get your customers to come back again?”, “Paper punch-cards are forgotten/lost”, “Need low-cost digital loyalty for your business”  
- Messaging: “Launch a digital loyalty card in minutes — boost repeat visits, increase customer retention”  
- Call to action: “Start free trial today, no credit card needed”

### b) Consumers  
- Segment: Regular customers of cafés/retail in Nairobi (ages 18-45)  
- Pain points: “Want rewards from places you frequent?”, “Keep all your loyalty cards in one app”  
- Messaging: “Join loyalty cards at your favourite local stores, get free rewards fast”  
- Call to action: “Download the App and scan the QR next time you visit”

## 3. Marketing Channels & Tactics  
| Channel                         | Target                | Key Tactic                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content Marketing / SEO        | Merchants             | Blog posts/guide: “How to increase repeat customers for Kenyan café” → capture leads |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads          | Merchants & Consumers  | Ads for merchants: “Start free loyalty card”; for consumers: “Find loyalty deals near you” |
| App Store / Play Store          | Consumers             | App listing optimised for keywords: “loyalty card”, “digital punch card Kenya” |
| Partnerships & Listings         | Merchants             | List on SaaS directories, small-business tooling sites in Kenya/E Africa    |
| Referral / Viral Loops         | Both segments         | Merchants refer merchants; consumers refer friends → bonus stamps         |
| Paid Search (Google Ads)        | Merchants             | Keywords like “digital loyalty program Kenya”, “repeat customers app small business” |
| Retargeting Ads                 | Website visitors      | Use Facebook/Google retargeting to bring back visitors who didn’t sign-up |

## 4. Funnel & Growth Workflow  
1. Merchant sees ad or organic blog → visits landing page → signs up for free trial  
2. Automated welcome email + onboarding flow → merchant configures their card → receives QR/link  
3. Merchant displays QR in-store (poster, tabletop, website) → customers scan → install app → join card  
4. Customer visits merchant, earns stamps → app sends notifications → reward redemption → positive experience  
5. Merchant sees repeat visits metrics → upgrades to paid plan  
6. Referral loop: merchant invites peer business → both get bonus period; consumer invites friends → both get extra stamps  
7. Use content + case study: highlight early successful merchants to attract more merchants.

## 6. Metrics & KPIs to Track  
- Merchant sign-up rate (free and paid)  
- Cost per merchant acquisition (CPA)  
- Customer app installs (consumer side)  
- Average number of customers per merchant  
- Repeat visit rate (stamps earned per customer per month)  
- Conversion rate free → paid merchant plans  
- Viral coefficient (how many new users via referral)  
- Merchant churn rate  
- Customer 30-day retention (on app)  
- Return on ad spend (ROAS) for paid campaigns

## 7. Budget Considerations  
- Initial ad budget: allocate modest (e.g., USD 300-500 or equivalent in local currency for first month) to test ad creatives/targeting  
- Content creation: blog + downloadable guide (cost = your time or freelancer cost)  
- Landing page and analytics: Setup cost if needed (Domain/hosting/CMS)  
- Referral incentives: Budget for bonus stamps or free trial extension — ensure it’s built into promotion cost  

## 8. Automated Onboarding & Self-Service Flow  
- Use email automation (Mailchimp, ConvertKit) to send onboarding sequence to new merchants  
- Provide downloadable assets: branded poster templates for QR, social media images, customer email template  
- Create a knowledge-base or FAQ page to reduce support overhead  
- Use analytics dashboard to trigger in-app tips or emails (e.g., “You’ve reached 80% of your free-trial limit — upgrade now”)  

## 9. Localization & Market Fit (Kenya / East Africa)  
- Use local language or culturally relevant visuals in ads and landing pages (e.g., Swahili/English mix)  
- Integrate local payment methods for subscriptions (MPesa, Airtel Money) to reduce friction  
- Highlight local businesses in case studies for social proof (in Nairobi or region)  
- Use geo-targeting for ads: focus on Nairobi metro first, then expand regionally  

## 10. Risk Mitigation & Adjustments  
- If ad cost per merchant is too high → shift more budget to content/SEO or partnerships  
- If consumer side adoption is slow → highlight referral bonuses / partner with local influencers  
- If merchant retention is low → implement loyalty insights (show merchants what benefits they’re getting)  
- If onboarding friction high → simplify flow further, reduce steps, improve UI
