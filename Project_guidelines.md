# Project Guidelines  
**Digital Loyalty / Punch-Card App for Small Businesses**

## 1. Vision & Goal  
Provide a simple self-service platform that enables cafés, salons, small retailers and business owners to launch a digital loyalty / punch-card program in minutes — enabling increased repeat visits, customer retention and engagement — with minimal manual setup.

## 2. Target Audiences  
- **Merchants**: Small-to-medium bricks-&-mortar businesses (cafés, beauty salons, small retail shops)  
- **Consumers**: Customers of those merchants who engage with loyalty programmes and drive repeat spending

## 3. MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)  
### Merchant Dashboard (Web & Mobile Responsive)  
- Signup / onboarding wizard: business info, logo, business type, plan selection  
- Configure loyalty programme: “X visits → reward”, stamp settings, reward description  
- Upload logo, choose colour/theme, customise card layout  
- Generate QR code/link for customers to join/stamp  
- Basic analytics: number of customers joined, stamps issued, rewards redeemed, repeat rate  
- Subscription/payment integration: free trial tier, then paid plan (monthly or annual)

### Customer-side App (Mobile or PWA)  
- Install app (iOS/Android) or open in browser (PWA)  
- Browse “Participating merchants near you” or join via QR code/link  
- Receive digital stamp when visiting merchant (either merchant scans QR, or merchant taps “Add stamp” in dashboard)  
- View loyalty card: stamps progress, reward status  
- Redeem reward when threshold met: app displays code or “show this in-store”  
- Push/in-app notifications: e.g., “You just got a stamp!”, “One more to your free reward!”, “Redeem now!”

## 4. Nice-to-Have / Phase 2 Features  
- Wallet integration (Apple Wallet / Google Wallet pass)  
- Multi-merchant network: allow stamps across a group of merchants  
- Referral system: customers refer friends → bonus stamps; merchants invite other merchants  
- Geo-location offers: when near merchant, push deal/bonus  
- Tiered reward system (Gold/Silver), gamification layer  
- POS/payment integration for automatic stamp trigger  
- Campaign builder for merchants (double-stamp day, birthday bonus)  
- Customer profiling & advanced analytics (segmentation)  

## 5. User Flows  
1. Merchant arrives on landing page → clicks “Start free trial” → completes signup wizard → configures loyalty card → obtains QR/link → downloads poster or uses social media share.  
2. Customer receives QR/link (in store or online) → installs app or opens PWA → joins merchant’s card → visits merchant → gets stamped → uses app to redeem reward when threshold met.  
3. Merchant logs into dashboard → views analytics → sees increased repeat visits → decides to upgrade plan.

## 6. Technology & Stack Suggestions  
- Front-end: React (web dashboard), React Native (mobile apps) or next.js / PWA version for simpler cross-platform  
- Back-end: Node.js (Express) or Python (Django/Flask) with REST API  
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing merchants, customers, stamps, rewards  
- Auth: JWT tokens / OAuth if necessary  
- Payment: Stripe / PayPal (if available in region) or local payment integration (MPesa in Kenya region)  
- Hosting: Heroku, AWS (EC2 + RDS) or DigitalOcean for cost-effective hosting  
- Analytics: integrate simple analytics (Google Analytics / Firebase Analytics) for app usage  
- Deployment: CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for fast iterations  
- QR code generation: server‐side library to generate unique QR per merchant card  
- Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android/iOS) or web push for PWA

## 7. Minimum Viable Timeline  
| Phase        | Duration      | Key Deliverables                              |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Planning     | 1 week        | User stories, wireframes, database schema     |
| MVP Build    | 2–3 weeks     | Merchant dashboard + customer app basic flow  |
| Testing      | ~1 week       | QA, merchant onboarding pilot, consumer flow  |
| Launch       | ~1 week       | Landing page live, free trial merchants onboard|
Total ≈ 4–6 weeks (depending on your team/time)

## 8. KPIs & Success Metrics  
- Merchant sign-ups (free tier)  
- Conversion rate from free to paid plan  
- Number of active loyalty cards (merchants)  
- Average number of customers per merchant  
- Average repeat visit rate/customer (monthly)  
- Customer app installs and weekly/30-day retention  
- Viral coefficient (number of referring merchants/users)  
- Churn rate of merchants

## 9. Risks & Mitigations  
- Low merchant adoption → Mitigate: free trial, quick onboarding, highlight case studies  
- Low customer usage → Mitigate: push notifications, visible QR codes in store, incentives  
- Technical complexity too high → Mitigate: begin with web-only or PWA version; postpone native apps  
- Payment barriers (region) → Mitigate: integrate local payment methods, simple subscription model  
- High support demands → Mitigate: build self-service onboarding, automated emails, knowledge-base docs
